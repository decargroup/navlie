    "# Jacobians in navlie\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may know, many state estimation algorithm require access to process model and measurement model Jacobians, with respect to the state and sometimes other inputs. For states belonging to Lie groups, algorithms will require _Lie Jacobians_, which differ from traditional derivatives as they conform to the constraints of the group. The abstraction provided by the $\\oplus$ and $\\ominus$ operators (implemented with `State.plus` and `State.minus` respectively) allow for a generic definition of a derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left.\\frac{D f(\\mathcal{X})}{D \\mathcal{X}}\\right|_{\\bar{\\mathcal{X}} }\\triangleq \\left.\\frac{\\partial f(\\bar{\\mathcal{X}} \\oplus \\delta \\mathbf{x}) \\ominus f(\\bar{\\mathcal{X}})}{\\partial \\delta \\mathbf{x}}\\right|_{\\delta \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be shown to fall back to a traditional derivatives when  $\\oplus$ and $\\ominus$ are defined to be regular addition/subtraction. This derivative definition is used universally throughout navlie, and roughly follows what is done in the [Micro Lie Theory paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01537.pdf). In that reference, seperate definitions are given for \"left\" and \"right\" derivatives, whereas we have aggregated them into a single definition, with left and right derivatives naturally arising from the choice of $\\oplus$ and $\\ominus$ operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you dont want to worry about this, the good news is that navlie computes Lie Jacobians for you by default using finite difference. However, finite difference can have some drawbacks, such as being computationally expensive and less accurate than analytic derivatives. In this notebook, we will show you how to use analytic derivatives in navlie, which offer the maximum accuracy and speed.\n",
